If any userspace program does not run please use chmod 777 as root and check again

Since a pid of the thread is the same as pid of main thread (process) i have used (int)pthread_self() to display the thread ids. They may  be negative.

Any way to compile run and expectations are described in the relevant tasks readme file.
