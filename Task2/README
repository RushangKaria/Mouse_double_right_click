APPROACH

The approach i have taken is to set alarm(1) ...1 second computation whenever the main() starts... it is the first line of main

Then it sets up the handler and long jump and begins to increment a variable.

When the alarm occurs the execution transfers to the handler which long jumps back, but this time the setjmp() condition fails.

The result is printed and the program quits.
