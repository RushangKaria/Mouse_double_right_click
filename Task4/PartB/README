PART B

To compile 

make

to run

signal_to_all


APPROACH

A library is created to deal with sending one signal to all the threads ---> the signal handler is the library

Please copy the library *.so files to /usr/lib and execute ldconfig (on the beagleboard)-->cross compile on VM ----- you can use the copy script that i provided ...type ./copy

you may use chmod 0755 on the file if you want

Once ldconfig completes you can run it

APPROACH

My approach goes as follows

I implement a single handler for the entire program

I have a single handler thread (in this case main) whose job is to catch the first signal

In other words, The kernel issues a signal to the process.

The signal handler is invoked, a check is made to see if the handler is running in the context of the main thread. 

If no, then the signal is redirected to the main thread using pthread_kill(), Now the signal is guaranteed to be dealt in the context of the main thread since thread signalling is used and not process signalling.

The main thread duplicates the signal and sends it to all the threads
Threads who are registered receive and quit...threads who are not registered continue and then quit when they increment a variable to a certain no
