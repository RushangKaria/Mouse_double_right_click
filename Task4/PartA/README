APPROACH

I create few threads and a main thread. I use SIGIO signal on the event1 associated with mouse0 ( Please change the file descriptor ) open method if there are any problems

First I set up a signal handler in the main thread so that all the threads can inherit the signals. 
After creating the threads I block all the threads for the main thread ( I did this because the main thread was catching all the signals always)

The threads unblock the signals and start doing there work of incrementing and sleeping for about 5 iterations.

Whenever a signal comes one thread catches the signal. The proof is that the signal handler executes only once per signal.

Consider a signal as a mouse-click. Do not scroll the mouse please (since a lot of signals are generated)

One mouse click generates one signal 

Therefore one for left click press
One for left click release

So two signals per click

Observe output and thread id.
